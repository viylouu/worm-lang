# WORM
**worm** is a low level data oriented pseudo-esolang designed around the use of folders, states, minimal syntactic sugar, and manual memory management.  
its goal is to really make you think when writing complex code.
### features
- folder/state memory structure
- experimental syntax
- dynamic typing until used (unless explicitly stated to be static)
- pseudo-arrays
- push / pop memory
- neovim syntax highlighting through regex
### example
example is test.worm (after all the comments for how stuff works)
### in the future (if this still is a thing)
- more complete standard library
- graphics and audio support (through vulkan/opengl)
- full interpreter written in odin
### status
currently developing syntax, open to suggestions
